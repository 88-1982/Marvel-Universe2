# Name of Student:DeAunte Hall

# Name of Project: Marvel Universe2

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
### My project will allow the user to find their favorite super hero and their bio also the creator plus comics they appeared in.


## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 

### My project will use an API to find selected hero and all comics and dates said comics were issued.

* The user should be able to select their favorite Marvel super hero.

* Once hero is selected by the user an image of the selected hero will be displayed in the DOM a picture will displayed (browser)

* The user will now have the ablility to veiw hero's stats.  (Place of birth,Super Powers,date of appearance etc)

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

### When I build out my project I would like to have a RPG style battle with the super heros that user has selected.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?




### At this point I will have to do more resarch on how I can build out the battle between the selected heros.

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

### I am trying to use technologies that have not been taught in class to challages myself a bit, such as scss,axios,sinon,enzyme and PHP. I hope to be able to incorporate them in my capstone project
